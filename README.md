# Learning Python 🐍

This repository contains my Python practice while rebuilding my coding foundation from scratch.

## What I’m learning
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists and tuples

## Structure
Each file represents daily practice:
- day01_variables.py
- More files will be added as I progress.

## Goal
To build strong programming logic and confidence in Python through consistent practice.
